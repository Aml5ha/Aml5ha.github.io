            As a summer camp counselor at the YMCA, I was responsible for groups of children ages 6-11. 
            Along with supervising and engaging with the children in my group, this opportunity taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork and leadership, as the children in my group never failed to surprise me.
            Notably, I was first counselor to be awarded as the counselor of the week, get recognized the first week of camp!

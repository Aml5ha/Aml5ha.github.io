        <h2>Twitter: Unfollow List</h2>
        <h3>It's always heartbreaking to see who doesn't follow you back. Providing an easy way to see who to unfollow ðŸ˜ˆ</h3>
        <p> 
        These days there is a stigma of having an imbalanced following to followers ratio. 
        This program lets you efficiently and easily see who you follow but doesnt follow you back.
        This project was done using Selenium with python to launch a session of twitter. 
        After the login credentials are entered, the program navigates to the user's following page. 
        Then, whenever a user does not have a "Follow you" tag next to their handle, their name is printed to a file.
